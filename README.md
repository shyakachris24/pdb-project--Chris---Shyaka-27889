## Issues Faced & How I resolved Them

- **Issue 1**: *Encountered ORA-xxxx error while creating PDB.*
  - **Solution**: Ensured that the database had sufficient storage and the default tablespace was set properly.

- **Issue 2**: *OEM not loading initially.*
  - **Solution**: Restarted the `emctl` service and reconfigured the listener.

##  Conclusion

Successfully completed all tasks including the creation and deletion of PDBs and OEM configuration. The assignment reinforced concepts of multitenant database architecture and provided hands-on experience with administrative tasks in Oracle.
